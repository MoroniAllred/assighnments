    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds 
        of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that 
        renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
    <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
    <!--the <ul> tag as well as the <ol> tag stand for unorder-list and ordered-list.
         They are both tags used for making lists when used with there child tag 
         the <li> tag. the only diference is how the list will show up if you use the 
        un list the list will be made with dots in the front. If you use the ordered 
        list then the list will show up with numbers starting in 1 -->
    <ul>
        <!--the <li> is put under the <ul> or the <ol> these will set up the list-->
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade
        </li>
    </ul>
