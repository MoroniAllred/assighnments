            <p class="topClassifieds">Due to us needing to wright a clasifieds page I have found the need for 
                someone to gather a list of jobs that need to be filled here at VSchool and give them to the VSchool
                newspaper deveilper. </p>
            <p class="topClassifieds">Some of the students here At VSchool decided that... bla bla bla bla. Due to 
                this decision... bla bla bla bla bla. Thus the need for.... If interested plese talk to the head of 
                comitty that had the discution.</p>
            <p class="topClassifieds">While working on this project, the idea acured that I am quickly running out of 
                space fillers. If you have a frined that can't stop talking please record their conversation and turn 
                it into a text document. These text documents can be turned into any of the newspaper wrighters here
                at VSchool.</p>
            <p class="lowerClassifieds">This section you can totaly skip. It has no real importance to anybody, except 
                the for the newspaper editor, so we can stress the need for text fillers, or remove the classifieds 
                page completly. We could drop the page for now and add in a help wanted sction if we ever have somthing 
                that we want help for. Just a thought I know it is above my pay grade and everything. If anyone other then 
                the read this, I would be sorry but I did warn you previously.</p>
            <p class="lowerClassifieds">I just needed one more box, so this is it.</p>
