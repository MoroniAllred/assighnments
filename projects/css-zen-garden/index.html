                <p>A demonstration of what can be accomplished though <span>CSS</span>-based design. 
                    Select any style sheet from the list to load it into this page.</p>
                <p>Download the example <a href="" class="down"><Span class="sym">D</Span>HTML FILE</a> and 
                    <a href="" class="down"><span class="sym">D</span>CSS FILE</a>
                <h2>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past rwlics of browser-specific tags,
                    incompatible <span>DOM</span>s, broken <span>CSS</span> support,
                    and abandoned browsers.</p>
                <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
                    thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <span>W3C,</span> 
                    <span>WASP,</span> and the major browser creators.</p>
                <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
                    lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
                    time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashions. Become one
                    with the web.</p>     
                <h2>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS</span>. The 
                Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To Begin, view 
                some of the exsisting designs in the list. clicking on any one will load the stle 
                sheet into this very page. The <span>HTML</span> remains the same, the onlyu thing
                that has changed is the external <span>CSS</span> file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p><span>CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext 
                    document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people
                    excited is by demonstrating wht it can truly be, once the reins are placed
                    in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
                    coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always
                        push it further.</p>

                            <p>Stron visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page,
                                so strong <span>CSS</span> skills are necessary too, but the exampls files
                                are commented well enough that even <span>CSS</span> novices can use them
                                as starting points. Please see the <span>CSS</span> Resource Guide for 
                                advanced tutorials and tips on working with <span>CSS</span>.</p>
                            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <span>HTML
                            </span>. This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way before,
                            but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
                            </p>
                            <p>Download the sample <a href="">HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> to work on a copy
                                locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and  please, don't
                                submit half-finised work) upload your <span>CSS</span> file to a web server
                                under your control. <a href="">Send us a link</a> to an archive of 
                                that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we 
                                will download it and place it on our server.</p>

                <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
                <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span>CSS 1 & 2</span> usage.
                    <samp>CSS 3 & $</samp> should be limited to widely-supported elements 
                    only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                    functional, practical <span>CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge
                    thricks viewable by 2% of the public. The only real requirement we have
                        is that your <span>CSS</span> validates</p>
                <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented
                    <span>CSS</span> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see 
                    fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer
                    number of user agents on the web these days -- pixel-perfect lyyouts 
                    may not be possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in 
                    as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest 
                    Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
                    population).</p>        
                <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyrifght laws.
                    Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate
                    unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're past the point 
                    of needing another garden-related design.</p>
                <p>Thios is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full 
                    copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="">submission
                    guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <span>CSS</span> under
                    a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href=""> one on this site
                    </a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
